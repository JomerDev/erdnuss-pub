# Erdnuss Comms

This is the core engine of the Erdnuss RS-485 comms protocol.

## Versioning

I plan to get this to v1.0 ASAP. Likely this will be gated on me getting docs finished, and maybe
updating a few dep versions.

Until then:

* breaking changes will increment the minor version with another 9, e.g. `0.9.x` -> `0.99.x` -> `0.999.x`
* non-breaking changes will increment the trivial version with another 9, e.g. `0.x.9` -> `0.x.99`. This probably won't reset on breaking changes, because that's funnier.
